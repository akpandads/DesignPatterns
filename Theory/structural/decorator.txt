need is to modify an existing object with additional functionality.
constraints are:
should not rewrite or alter existing code (OCP principle)
the new functionality should be kept separate (SRP principle)
should be able to interact with existing structures.

2 ways of doing it:
1. Inherit from object and modify( but not possible when classes are final)
2. Build decorator which references the object.

Decorator pattern facilitates addition of behaviour to objects without inheriting them.
may or may not forward/delegate calls
Exists in static decoration

A prototype is a partially or fully implemented construct which is used for creating new objects and modify them.
The new objects created from the prototype must not affect the original object
Hence when creating anew object from prototype a deep copy needs to be performed.
A deep copy is when you create a new object from an existing object, keeping in mind that the new object and  its references in no way point to the old object or its referenfces.
This can be achieved by defining copy (constructors or custom deep copy methods) or a simple serializa and deserialize on an object.

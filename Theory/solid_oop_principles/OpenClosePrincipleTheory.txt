Open for extension
Closed for modification

Tradition disadvantage:
Assuming class product has hundreds of attribute, writing a filter in traditional way will violate the open close principle and in turn decrease maintainability and testability of code.
if open close principe is not followed then is most liklihood the existing code needs tobe changed

Advantage of OC principle is that all new funxtionality can be added without making any modification ot existing class.

Example:

The ProductFilter class has all the filter methods defined in them.
Any additional filter condition will require modification in the exiting ProductFilter class

The EnhancedProductFilter class uses the interfaces Specfication and Filter.
Any new filter conditions will require a new specification class created.

To summarize,

it is open to inherit or implement things.
Not allaowed to modify the existing working functionality
